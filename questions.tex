\textbf{Explanation:} Option A is incorrect because gravity varies slightly depending on location. It's slightly stronger at the poles and weaker at the equator due to Earth's oblate shape.
Option B is correct. As altitude increases, distance from the Earth's center increases, so gravity decreases according to the inverse square law.
Option C is wrong. The poles are closer to the Earth's center due to the oblate shape, so gravity is stronger at the poles.

\textbf{B.} It is increasing at a constant rate. \\
\textbf{C.} It is increasing at a decreasing rate. \\
\textbf{D.} It is not changing. \\

\textbf{Answer:} A \\
\textbf{Explanation:} The magnetic force F = -kv (where k is a constant), so the acceleration a = F/m = -kv/m. The magnitude of the acceleration is |a| = kv/m. Since the sphere is accelerated by a forward force, the velocity v increases with time. This causes |a| to also increase accordingly. The rate of increase in velocity v depends on a, thus resulting in a scenario similar to exponential growth. The rate at which |a| increases also increases over time, meaning the rate of acceleration's increase is gradually increasing. Therefore, option A is correct.

\textbf{B.} It is increasing at a constant rate. \\
\textbf{C.} It is increasing at a decreasing rate. \\
\textbf{D.} It is not changing. \\

\textbf{Answer:} F \\
\textbf{Explanation:} Analysis: In a state of uniform motion, the resultant force is zero: the buoyancy B is equal to the sum of the weight mg and the resistance f. As the mass m increases linearly, the weight mg also increases, thereby resulting in the resultant force Fnet = B - mg - f. Since B and f are constant, Fnet decreases linearly with m. According to Newton's second law, a = Fnet / m, Fnet and m both change linearly. Substituting Fnet = B - mg - f into a, we get a = (B - mg - f) / m = (B - f) / m - g. As m increases linearly, (B - f) / m also decreases linearly, causing a to decrease linearly as well. Therefore, the acceleration decreases at a constant rate, so option F is correct.

. \\
\textbf{C.} It is increasing at a decreasing rate. \\
\textbf{D.} It is not changing. \\

\textbf{Answer:} B \\
\textbf{Explanation:} Analysis: The traction force F(t) increases linearly, while the resistance f remains constant. The net force Fnet = F(t) - f. When F(t) > f, the net force is positive, and the acceleration a = Fnet / m increases linearly with the increase of F(t) until it reaches a constant value. This means that the magnitude (positive value) of the acceleration increases at a constant rate until it reaches the constant value.

\textbf{C.} It is increasing at a decreasing rate. \\
\textbf{D.} It is not changing. \\

\textbf{Answer:} A \\
\textbf{Explanation:} Power P = Fv, so when the power remains constant, as the speed v decreases, the pulling force F = P/v will increase. According to Newton's second law F - mg = ma, when F increases, the resultant force F - mg will also increase, thereby causing the acceleration a = (F - mg) / m to also increase. However, since F = P/v, when F increases, the rate at which F increases will increase with v's decrease (because v is in the denominator), which leads to an increasing rate of acceleration increase, thus forming the phenomenon of the rate of acceleration increase gradually increasing. Therefore, the rate of increase of acceleration is gradually increasing, so option A is correct.

\textbf{Explanation:} Option A is incorrect because gravity varies slightly depending on location. It's slightly stronger at the poles and weaker at the equator due to Earth's oblate shape.
Option B is correct. As altitude increases, distance from the Earth's center increases, so gravity decreases according to the inverse square law.
Option C is wrong. The poles are closer to the Earth's center due to the oblate shape, so gravity is stronger at the poles.

\textbf{Q781.} A car travels on a straight road with its traction force decreasing linearly over time until it reaches a constant value. Assuming constant resistance, how does the magnitude of the car’s acceleration change?

decreases linearly as
F

F

\textbf{B.} It is increasing at a constant rate. \\
\textbf{C.} It is increasing at a decreasing rate. \\
\textbf{D.} It is not changing. \\

\textbf{Answer:} G \\
\textbf{Explanation:} Power
P
=
Fv
, so with constant power, as speed
v
increases, the tension force
F
=
P
/
v
decreases. By Newton’s second law
F
−
mg
=
ma
, as
F
decreases, the net force
F
−
mg
decreases, causing acceleration
a
=(
F

m
to decrease. However, since
F
=
P
/
v
, the rate at which
F
decreases slows down as
v
increases (because
v

\textbf{Explanation:} According to the law of reflection, the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection. After the first reflection from the first mirror, the reflected ray makes an angle of
45
\circ 
with the first mirror.
Next, the reflected ray strikes the second mirror. Since the angle between the two mirrors is 60
\circ

45

According to the law of reflection, the reflected ray from the second mirror also makes an angle of
45
\circ 
with the second mirror. After two reflections, the angle between the emergent ray and the original incident ray can be calculated as 120

\circ

[IMAGE:0]



\textbf{A.} 30° \\
\textbf{B.} 60° \\
\textbf{C.} 90° \\
\textbf{D.} 120° \\

\textbf{Answer:} D \\
\textbf{Explanation:} According to the law of reflection, the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection. After the first reflection from the first mirror, the reflected ray makes an angle of 30
\circ 
with the first mirror.
Next, the reflected ray strikes the second mirror. Since the angle between the two mirrors is 60
\circ 
, the angle between the incident ray and the second mirror can be calculated as 30
\circ 
(because the angle between the reflected ray from the first mirror and the second mirror is equal to the angle between the two mirrors minus the angle between the reflected ray and the first mirror).
According to the law of reflection, the reflected ray from the second mirror also makes an angle of 30
\circ 
with the second mirror. After two reflections, the angle between the emergent ray and the original incident ray can be calculated as 120
\circ 
(since the angle between the two mirrors is 60
\circ

\textbf{A.} 1Pa \\
\textbf{B.} 2Pa \\
\textbf{C.} 4Pa \\
\textbf{D.} 8Pa \\

\textbf{Answer:} A \\
\textbf{Explanation:} The formula for pressure is: P=F/A    where P is pressure, F is the force (here, the weight of the metal block), and A is the area over which the force is applied. Since the thickness of the metal block remains constant, its weight F also remains unchanged. Therefore, the new pressure P′ is: P^'=F/A^' =F/4A=1/4 P The original pressure is 4 Pascals, so the new pressure is: 1/4×4=1Pa

\textbf{C.} X:kineticenergy  Y:velocity  Z:potentialenergy \\
\textbf{D.} X：resultant force  Y:fluidresistance  Z:momentum \\

\textbf{Answer:} E \\
\textbf{Explanation:} The object experiences a constant thrust, but fluid resistance increases with velocity until it balances the thrust. The resultant force (X) decreases to zero (curve declines to zero). Velocity (Y) increases asymptotically toward terminal velocity (curve rises and stabilizes). The object’s mass remains constant, so its weight (Z) is unchanged (horizontal line). Option E is correct. Other options fail because: A’s Z (kinetic energy) should keep increasing; B’s Y (mass) and Z (weight) are constants, but X (acceleration) should decrease; C and D have mismatched physical quantities; F’s X (momentum) should increase, not decrease.

\textbf{Answer:} B \\
\textbf{Explanation:} When an object falls through a fluid, it experiences:
Weight (downward, constant).
Buoyant Force (upward, constant if fully submerged).
Drag Force (upward, increases with velocity).
The Resultant Force is calculated as Weight−(Buoyant Force+Drag Force). As velocity increases, drag increases, causing the resultant force to decrease until it reaches zero at terminal velocity.
X (Resultant Force): Decreases over time, matching the X graph.
Y (Velocity): Starts at zero and asymptotically approaches terminal velocity, matching the Y graph.
Z (Weight of Object): Remains constant, matching the horizontal Z graph.

where h is the height, R is the radius of the bottom base, and r is the radius of the top base.When the height h and the radius r of the top base are both doubled, the new volume V′ becomes: V^'=1/3 π(2h)($R^2$+R(2r)+(2r)^2 )=2/3 πh($R^2$+2Rr+$4r^2$ )

\textbf{Explanation:} Initially, the downward air resistance balances the net upward force (buoyancy minus weight) at terminal velocity. After releasing the instruments, the mass reduces to m/3
and the cross-sectional area increases to 2A. Using the terminal velocity formula

the reduced mass significantly decreases the net downward force (potentially dominated by buoyancy). The downward resistance must now balance a smaller net force. Additionally, the increased A and reduced vt cause the drag force

As the skier begins to slide down the slope, velocity increases gradually, and so does the drag force (since drag is proportional to the square of velocity).
When drag balances the component of weight along the slope, the skier reaches the first stable velocity, and drag stabilizes.
Upon entering smoother snow, the friction coefficient decreases suddenly, causing a sharp drop in drag force.
Drag force balances the component of weight along the slope again, and the skier reaches a new stable velocity with stabilized drag.

\textbf{B.} [IMAGE:1] \\

\textbf{Answer:} A \\
\textbf{Explanation:} The variation of drag force is as follows:
As the raindrop begins to fall, velocity increases gradually, and so does the drag force (since drag is proportional to the square of velocity).
When drag balances weight, the raindrop reaches the first terminal velocity, and drag stabilizes.
Upon entering the denser cloud layer, the air density increases suddenly, causing a sharp rise in drag force.
Drag force balances weight again, and the raindrop reaches a new terminal velocity with stabilized drag.

\textbf{Answer:} B \\
\textbf{Explanation:} Initially, the air resistance equals the hailstone’s weight (mg), stabilizing at terminal velocity. After melting, the mass halves (0.5m), and the cross-sectional area reduces to 0.5 times (0.5A). Using the terminal velocity formula
[IMAGE:0]
the new terminal velocity remains unchanged:
[IMAGE:1]
However, the air resistance must now balance the new weight (0.5mg). Despite the unchanged vt​, the reduced A directly lowers the drag force to 0.5mg. Thus, the resistance drops abruptly to the new equilibrium, corresponding to option B.

\textbf{Q1166.} An object starts from a state of rest and, under the action of a constant thrust in a fluid, accelerates its motion.

\textbf{A.} X: acceleration; Y: fluid resistance; Z: kinetic energy \\

\textbf{C.} X: kinetic energy; Y: velocity; Z: potential energy \\
\textbf{D.} X: resultant force; Y: fluid resistance; Z: momentum \\

\textbf{Answer:} E \\
\textbf{Explanation:} The object experiences a constant thrust, but fluid resistance increases with velocity until it balances the thrust. The resultant force (X) decreases to zero (curve declines to zero). Velocity (Y) increases asymptotically toward terminal velocity (curve rises and stabilizes). The object’s mass remains constant, so its weight (Z) is unchanged (horizontal line). Option E is correct. Other options fail because: A’s Z (kinetic energy) should keep increasing; B’s Y (mass) and Z (weight) are constants, but X (acceleration) should decrease; C and D have mismatched physical quantities; F’s X (momentum) should increase, not decrease.

\textbf{Explanation:} Initially, the downward air resistance balances the net upward force (buoyancy minus weight) at terminal velocity. After releasing the instruments, the mass reduces to m/3
and the cross-sectional area increases to 2.5A. Using the terminal velocity formula

the reduced mass significantly decreases the net downward force (potentially dominated by buoyancy). The downward resistance must now balance a smaller net force. Additionally, the increased A and reduced vt cause the drag force

the new terminal velocity remains unchanged:

However, the air resistance must now balance the new weight (0.5mg). Despite the unchanged vt

When the resistance is balanced with the gravity, the object reaches the first terminal velocity and the resistance becomes stable.
After entering the fluid layer with higher density, the resistance coefficient suddenly increases, causing the resistance to rise sharply.

\textbf{Q1232.} A physics student is experimenting with gas expansion. A balloon filled with helium is placed in water baths of different temperatures. The balloon has an initial volume of 2 liters at 20°C. The student observes how the volume changes when the balloon is placed in water at different temperatures. Assuming the pressure remains constant, which water temperature will cause the balloon to expand the most?



\textbf{A.} Water Temperature (°C): 30°C; Initial Volume (V₁): 2 liters; Initial Temperature (T₁): 20°C \\
\textbf{B.} Water Temperature (°C): 40°C; Initial Volume (V₁): 2 liters; Initial Temperature (T₁): 20°C \\
\textbf{C.} Water Temperature (°C): 10°C; Initial Volume (V₁): 2 liters; Initial Temperature (T₁): 20°C \\
\textbf{D.} Water Temperature (°C): 50°C; Initial Volume (V₁): 2 liters; Initial Temperature (T₁): 20°C \\

\textbf{Answer:} D \\
\textbf{Explanation:} The relationship between volume and temperature for an ideal gas at constant pressure is given by Charles's Law:

\textbf{Q1239.} A scientist wants to compare the thermal conductivity of different materials. Four identical rods (same length and cross-sectional area) made of different materials are placed between two reservoirs of water. The temperature of the left reservoir is 90°C, and the temperature of the right reservoir is 30°C. The rods are made of materials with different thermal conductivities.
Which rod will conduct thermal energy at the highest rate?



\textbf{A.} Material: X; Thermal Conductivity (k): 100 W/(m\cdot K) \\
\textbf{B.} Material: Y; Thermal Conductivity (k): 200 W/(m\cdot K) \\

\textbf{Explanation:} Since all rods have the same A, L, and ΔT, the heat transfer rate depends only on the thermal conductivity k. Option D (Material W) has the highest thermal conductivity (k=300W/(m\cdotpK)), so it will conduct thermal energy at the highest rate.

\textbf{Explanation:} To compare the heat absorbed in each process, we need to use the formulas for heat absorption:
Heat absorbed by ice from -20°C to 0°C:
[IMAGE:0]
Heat absorbed by ice melting at 0°C:
[IMAGE:1]
where
[IMAGE:2]
is the latent heat of fusion for ice.
Heat absorbed by water from 20°C to 40°C:
[IMAGE:3]
Given that the specific heat capacity of ice
[IMAGE:4]
is less than that of water
[IMAGE:5]
, we have:
[IMAGE:6]
Thus,

.
The latent heat of fusion
[IMAGE:8]
for ice is generally much larger than the specific heat capacities
[IMAGE:9]
and
